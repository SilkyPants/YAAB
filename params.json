{"name":"YAAB","body":"== YAAB - Yet Another Autococker Board\r\n\r\nNot much to say here really. Just an interesting project I've been wanting to do for a while, and thanks to the Arduino platform I now have a better understanding on how to do this. In short, this project will be utilising the [Arduino platform](http://arduino.cc) as a kick start to a custom board with the idea of keeping it all open source so that others can do with it what they want and learn at the same time :)\r\n\r\nWARNING: This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. It is simply a log of my development and learning as I go and what works for me.\r\n\r\nIf you want to follow the progess of this project, wander over to [the project blog.](http://silkypantsdan.wordpress.com/tag/yaab/)","tagline":"Yet Another Autococker Board.
