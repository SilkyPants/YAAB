== YAAB - Yet Another Autococker Board

Not much to say here really. Just an interesting project I've been wanting to do for a while, and thanks to the Arduino platform I now have a better understanding on how to do this. In short, this project will be utilising the Arduino platform as a kick start to a custom board with the idea of keeping it all open source so that others can do with it what they want and learn at the same time :)
